book.1.line.1=Queen Eleanor particularly liked fruit. She enjoyed British apples, pears, quince and grapes. She liked figs, pomegranates, lemons, oranges, dates, and raisins imported from Spain.
book.1.line.2=Queen Eleanor loved jewellery. She had her own goldsmith at Rhuddlan castle.
book.1.line.3=Queen Eleanor liked tapestries (artwork made by weaving wool, silk or cotton). Usually, they were hung on walls, but she introduced the idea of also having them on the floor as carpet.
book.1.line.4=Queen Eleanor employed 'fools', or 'little servants', we might think of jesters. Fools provided entertainment in the castle. We believe she particularly liked jokes and funny pictures. Entertainment could include acrobatics, music, singing and jokes.
book.1.line.5=Queen Eleanor loved to play chess. Her husband, King Edward I, gave her a red and green chess set made of jasper and crystal. Red and green were her favourite colours.
book.1.line.6=Queen Eleanor loved art and had pieces of art made especially for her, which were often in bright colours and gold. The most famous is a psalter (illustrated manuscript) created for her son, Alphonso.
book.1.line.7=Queen Eleanor wanted her bathroom to have coloured tiles on the walls as they had in Spain. This was a new way to decorate in Britain.
book.1.line.8=Queen Eleanor was very charitable. She donated a lot of money to the poor as well as providing meals for the poor during cold winter months. In April 1289 and November 1290, she provided funding for meals for 9306 paupers at a cost of 1½ d (pence) per meal. Feeding approximately 15 poor people a day.
book.1.line.9=Queen Eleanor loved to read. In fact, some sources describe her as a book addict! As far as we know, hers was the only royal court in Northern Europe to have a scriptorium (writing room). She employed two scribes and a Pictor, who copied the books that she wanted read.
book.1.line.10=The castle needed to look luxurious for Queen Eleanor with painted walls. One thing she particularly liked was wood panelling painted green and starred with gold. Red and green were her favourite colours. 
book.1.line.11=Queen Eleanor liked her luxuries! The castle needed to have a system for piping water directly into the Kings Bath House as well as glazed windows, perhaps even with coloured glass! 
book.1.line.12=Queen Eleanor and King Edward were described as being very much in love and described as being inseparable.
book.1.line.13=Eleanor liked to grow herbs for medicine. This likely included Hollyhocks, Dandelions and Thyme. We learnt from the Romans that the Dandelion is a highly nutritious herb believed to help in many ways, including ridding the body of toxins. 
book.1.line.16=Thyme is another herb brought to Britain by the Romans. It has strong, smelling leaves and small purple flowers. It was believed that putting It under a pillow would cure sadness, so it was recommended for soldiers who were homesick.
book.1.line.14=Queen Eleanor insisted that the castle had a garden with a lawn, herb garden and a water feature in the style of those that were fashionable in Castile, Spain at the time.
book.1.line.15=Queen Eleanor was Edward's first wife. She was born around 1241. She was originally from Castile in Spain, which is why she is also known as Eleanor of Castile. Her mother was French, so Eleanor spoke French as well as Spanish and some English.
book.1.line.17=Queen Eleanor and the King were in the East of England, near Lincoln when she died. It took several days to transport her body to Westminster Abbey, near London. King Edward I had twelve decorated stone crosses erected, one at each place they stopped for the night on the way to London.
book.1.line.18=King Edward I and Queen Eleanor are believed to have been married for 36 years.
book.1.line.19=Queen Eleanor was very well educated which was quite unusual for ladies at that time.
book.1.line.20=Queen Eleanor was also known for a lot of business deals involving acquiring land. It is believed that her involvement in business set the precedent for Queens to be allowed to run their own businesses.
book.1.line.21=Queen Eleanor had sixteen children, but they did not all survive. Her first son was born at Caernarvon castle.  
book.1.line.22=A coat of arms was created for Eleanor of Castile, Queen consort.
book.1.line.23=Eleanor was known for being very graceful and polite, and she always looked very nice when she was in court.
book.1.line.24=Eleanor probably had light skin, which was considered a sign of being noble and beautiful during the medieval times.
book.1.line.25=Eleanor was very smart and loved learning about literature, theology, and the law. She had many books about these subjects and was a very helpful partner to Edward I during his reign.
book.1.line.26=Queen Eleanor was a very kind and religious queen. She helped build and support places like monasteries and churches. This showed how much she cared about her faith and helping others.
book.1.line.27=As queen, Eleanor played an important part in helping to govern the kingdom. She helped take care of the royal home and land, and she also had an impact on the culture and economy. She was more than just a queen in name, she worked alongside Edward I and was a true partner in ruling the kingdom.
book.1.line.28=Queen Eleanor really liked designing and building beautiful castles and palaces. Her interest in architecture helped make the buildings of her time look very special and unique!
book.1.line.29=Queen Eleanor was a dedicated mother, deeply involved in her children's upbringing.
book.1.line.30=Queen Eleanor brought lots of cool things from Spain to England, like new clothes, yummy foods, and different ways of gardening. She even introduced a fruit called quince to England, which they used to make jelly.
book.1.line.31=Queen Eleanor loved books and learning. She collected a lot of books and was very interested in education, which was rare for women during the medieval period.

book.2.line.1=My Loyal Subjects,
book.2.line.2=I have sent my Chamberlain ahead to inform you of my imminent arrival at Conwy Castle.
book.2.line.3=I expect the Castle to be made ready for my visit. I am in need of much comfort at this time.
book.2.line.4=For my chambers, the Walls should be painted, and tapestries hung. The chill does seep into my bones, so my windows must be glazed at the very least, and some colour of the glass to gladden my eye would be better.
book.2.line.5=I have sent with the Chamberlain my most treasured chess set to place upon a table in my room and the coloured candles that I favour to cast a warm glow over my favourite game. A lawn must be laid in the Castle Garden with a fence all around. 
book.2.line.6=An Abundance of plants must be well bedded in and watered. 
book.2.line.7=I also desire:
book.2.line.8=i. A herb garden. ii. A water feature (ornamental fountain). iii. A fishpond with seats around it. iiv. An Aviary. v. A summer house. 
book.2.line.9=I shall be staying some days and expect you to organise entertainment, music and games to rouse the spirits and lighten the heart.
book.2.line.10=Queen Eleanor

book.3.line.1=The Clever Capture of Conwy Castle
book.3.line.2=Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Wales, there stood a mighty fortress known as Conwy Castle. Built by King Edward I of England, this grand stronghold's walls were tall and seemingly impenetrable. The king's soldiers, clad in gleaming armour, 
book.3.line.3=guarded every gate and tower, watching over the Welsh countryside with vigilant eyes.
book.3.line.4=But amidst the valleys and hills, there were whispers of rebellion. A brave and noble Welsh leader named Owain Glyndŵr had declared himself Prince of Wales. 
book.3.line.5=His dream was to free his beloved land from English rule and restore peace and harmony to his people.
book.3.line.6=Owain Glyndŵr had two clever and daring cousins, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur. These brothers were known throughout Wales for their courage and 
book.3.line.7=wit. One moonlit night, as the fireflies danced under the stars, the brothers hatched a bold plan to capture Conwy Castle.
book.3.line.8="We shall disguise ourselves as humble workmen," Rhys told his brother Gwilym. 
book.3.line.9="We will gain entry to the castle by blending in with the labourers who fix the walls and tend to the grounds."
book.3.line.10=The next morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of pink and gold, Rhys and Gwilym donned simple tunics, smeared dirt on their faces, and 
book.3.line.11=carried tools like ordinary workmen. They approached the castle gates, where the guards stood tall and stern.
book.3.line.12="Who goes there?" barked the captain of the guard.
book.3.line.13="We are but humble workmen," 
book.3.line.14=Rhys replied, his voice calm and steady. "We have come to repair the walls and tend to the grounds, as we do every day."
book.3.line.15=The captain of the guard, seeing nothing amiss, allowed the brothers to enter. 
book.3.line.16=It was April 1st. However, Rhys and Gwilym did not choose this day because it was April Fool's Day but because it was Good Friday. Because it was a special holy day, they knew that most of the garrison would attend a service in the church in town. 
book.3.line.17=The brothers knew this was an ideal opportunity; their moment had come.
book.3.line.18=Quick as a flash, Rhys and Gwilym signalled to their loyal men, who had been hiding nearby. With swift and silent movements, they overpowered the unsuspecting guards, 
book.3.line.19=securing the gates and towers. The castle was theirs!
book.3.line.20=For several months, the Welsh flag flew proudly over Conwy Castle, a beacon of hope and courage for all of Wales. The capture of the castle was a testament to the ingenuity and bravery of the Welsh 
book.3.line.21=people. News of their triumph spread far and wide, lifting the spirits of those who longed for freedom.
book.3.line.22=But King Henry IV was not one to be easily defeated. He ordered his forces to recapture the castle, and a brief siege ensued. 
book.3.line.23=Despite the valiant efforts of Rhys and Gwilym, the English forces eventually took back Conwy Castle.
book.3.line.24=Though the castle was lost, the tale of Rhys and Gwilym's daring capture lived on, inspiring countless generations. 
book.3.line.25=Owain Glyndŵr's rising continued, and the Welsh people's dream of independence burned brighter than ever.
book.3.line.26=And so, in the land of ancient legends and heroic deeds, the story of Conwy Castle and the clever Tudur brothers became a cherished part of Welsh 
book.3.line.27=history, a reminder that even the mightiest walls can be breached by the courage and cunning of those who dare to dream.
book.3.line.28= The End.
